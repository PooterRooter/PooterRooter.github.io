Vulnerability Assessments - Vulnerability assessments are required for many compliances, such as PCI and HIPAA and enable penetration tests to be smarter and more targeted compared to using simple port scans. Our approach to performing a vulnerability assessment exposes weaknesses in systems and identifies paths that are vulnerable to exploitation. Once completed, we are able to give recommendations on ways to reduce these exposures. 

(Typically includes a vulnerability scan of subnets and hosted services, summarized in an executive report. Advise on best practices and recommend changes.) (Price depends on scope of engagement.)

Security Compliance - If you have known security issues, or have recently completed a vulnerability assessment, Cerberus Consulting can be the one that drives your business towards a higher baseline of security. Whether it be industry-based compliance requirements or wanting to fix known holes in your business’s security, let us advise and help implement the best solutions for you. 

(Typically includes hardening of network appliances, servers, and an audit of network topology and firewall rules. Advising on endpoint hardening, security best practices internally and with cloud services.) (Price depends on scope of engagement.)

Cloud Server Migrations - We utilize providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Compute Engine (GCE), and Digital Ocean to help ensure uptime, reduce cost, and scale at the push of a button. Let us assist in moving your on-site, single purpose servers to a contained application in the cloud. Backed by these providers’ massive infrastructures, you have access to compute and storage resources when you need them.

Onsite Virtualization - Server virtualization is one of the greatest information technologies to be developed in modern days. Let us set up or migrate to a virtual machine host to help simplify infrastructure management, ease disaster recovery, isolate applications, allow for ad-hoc services, and best of all save costs in the long term. Consolidate your server infrastructure and maximize the effectiveness of your gear.
